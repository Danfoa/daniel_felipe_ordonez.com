I am a Ph.D. student of the European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems ([ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/)) doctoral program under the supervision of Dr. Claudio Semini ([DLS](https://dls.iit.it/)), Dr. Massimiliano Pontil ([CSML](https://ucl-ellis.github.io/)), and Dr. Carlos Mastalli ([RoMi](https://www.romilab.org/)). I received a Masters's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC-Barcelona Tech) and a Bachelors's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the Universidad Nacional De Colombia (UNAL).

I am interested in exploiting continuous and discrete symmetries of robotic systems in machine learning applications for robotics, specially for legged locomotion control.

**Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested in doing your Bachelor's/Master's thesis on symmetry exploitation methods for robot learning/control, or computational design.**
