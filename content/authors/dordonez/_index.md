I am an assistant researcher at the [Institute of Robotics and Industrial Informatics (IRI-CSIC)](https://www.iri.upc.edu/) under the supervision of [Dr. Francesc Moreno](https://www.iri.upc.edu/people/fmoreno/) and [Dr. Mario Martin](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~mmartin/). At IRI, I study the synthesis of realistic and natural dynamical motions of animated and robotic systems through reinforcement learning without MoCap references. I am deeply passionate about legged locomotion, optimal control, reinforcement learning, biomechanics, and most applications of machine learning aimed at closing the performance gap between nature and robotics systems.
